# Conclusive Benefits

## Lower Token Consumption

Fewer tokens consumed means:

- **Reduced API costs**: Direct savings on per-token billing
- **More headroom**: Longer sessions before hitting context limits
- **Faster responses**: Less data to process per turn

## Cleaner Context

Structured skill output keeps context more relevant:

- **Less drift**: Agent stays focused on the task, not distracted by irrelevant file content
- **Fewer hallucinations**: Smaller, more targeted context reduces confabulation risk
- **Better recall**: Important information stays within the attention window longer

## Improved Accuracy

Bounded, deterministic search parameters mean:

- **Reproducible results**: Same query produces same output
- **Auditable behavior**: Explicit parameters visible in logs
- **Self-correcting**: CLI emits validation errors the agent can act on
