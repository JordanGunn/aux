# Conclusion

The hypothesis that AUx skills improve agent efficiency is **confirmed**:

1. **Token reduction**: 31–36% less context consumed
2. **Quality preserved**: Coverage and accuracy maintained or improved
3. **Cost savings**: Low-reasoning + skills achieves ~35% of baseline cost
4. **Scalability**: Effect holds across reasoning tiers and complex codebases

These results support investing in structured, agent-owned tooling for production agentic workflows.
