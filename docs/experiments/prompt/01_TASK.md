# Task Prompt

I need you to analyze the authentication and authorization implementation across this codebase.

Specifically, identify all files related to authentication (OAuth2, tokens, sessions, login flows) and authorization (RBAC, permissions, role checks). Map which services/components handle auth vs which consume it. Note any security-relevant patterns (token validation, middleware, guards).
